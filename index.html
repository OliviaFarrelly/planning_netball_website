    <h2>Brief</h2>
        <p> I have been asked to develop a website for a netball squad called Hot Shots run by Dave Farrelly,
            this is a Wellington based squad<br>
            The objective is to create a website with information about the team and coaches, a place to find
            information about trains, a draw and results page blight, and a notices page that can also be updated.
            I also needed to make sure teh website was made fo rteh correct audience and was easy to undertsand and
            gave clear infromation across to anyone using the website(players, parents, coaches).

    <hr>


        Before starting the website I completed some User experince plannig. I looked at a few aspects to make sure my
        website was created for the correct reassn and teh right audience. Below are a few thingsi looked at when
        researching for my website.
        <ul>
        <li> I looked at the users that would be using this website an dhwat tehy needed to see wehn looking online.
           </li>
        <li> I also did some comeptition analysis I looked at other netball websites and deicde what aspects
            of teh website i liked and worked well fir the website and what apsects didnt work as well </li>
        <li> I also did research on other webistes that were not netball webistes and found aspects that i liked that
        i could use as inspiration for my website</li>
            <li> I also created drawn plans of what i pictured my website to look like (which can always change as teh
                website starts to be put together)</li>
        </ul>

    <h2> Relevant Implications Summary</h2>

                <div class="fw-bold">Functionality/Accessibility</div>
                This means the database should work properly. This means the foreign keys that link tabel together
                need to be correct so the correct members are associated with the news post they made. Also to keep
                everything running smoothly the data needs to be consistent meaning the format of dates and times should
                be kept the same using the SQLite format yYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:00‚Äù. To make sure databases are functional,
                testing is important as well as creating entity relationship diagrams to see how everything should
                connect with each other.

                <div class="fw-bold">Future-proofing</div>
                 Future-proofing is about being able to keep your website up to date. Any corrections made should be
                made in one place and if needed in other tabel stehy should be referenced using foreign keys. Foreign
                key means if the member is authorised to update teh notices the member tabel will have to be linked to
                the notices table using a foreign key. This means that if there were any updates done to a name or a
                otice it would be changed without needing to change a lot of different code. Whether the information
                can be easily altered and old data can be removed, adding new information allows users to update the
                website on the website rather than having to go through code and having to change a range of things
                and altering what is already there.

            <div class="ms-2 me-auto">
                <div class="fw-bold">Privacy</div>
                Privacy is about making sure the data from the website and personal data is kept private. Passwords
                should be kept hidden when they are typing them. As Well as making sure that the data from the
                databases is kept private meaning that when users access the webpage they should be taken to the
                webpage not to the data folder. It is also important to respect users' privacy so only collecting
                information that is needed for the website so you're not extracting unnecessary private information
                from users so there is less to keep private for them.
</div>
        </li>
            <li class="list-group-item d-flex justify-content-between align-items-start">
            <div class="ms-2 me-auto">
                <div class="fw-bold">End user considerations</div>
                This aspect was ensuring the database was arranged and organised to meet the needs of the users.
                It needs to be clear and easy to view as well as easy to understand. The database should be easy for
                the user to understand so forms that allow users to change aspects of the website should be easy to
                follow and should have validation to minimise errors and also help the user enter correct information
                to avoid problems.

        <!-- Heading levels -->
            <h3 class="sprint">Sprint One</h3>
            <p><b><i>Brief</i></b><br>
            In this sprint, I wanted to start adding the aspect of databases to my webpage. I first started with my
                notices section. I wanted to create a delete, add, and update section for this section. This allows
                authorised users to update and change the notice section to make it more relevant and up-to-date. I
                said the date and time and who submitted or made the notice change so people who know who made it
                and when they made it could clearly understand what the notice is trying to say.
</p>
<div class="container-lg plan">

        <div class = "row">
                <div class = "col-sm-6 backing">

              <h3 class="h3">Plan</h3>
              <hr>
                  <p class="subheading"> First, I created two tables: a notices table and a member table. The notice
                      table holds all the information about the notice so the title content, and the date. This is
                      connected to the member table, which has information on the coaching staff and the team members,
                      their emails and passwords, and whether they are authorised to make changes.

        </p>
              <p class="maintext">Tables are an excellent way to keep all information stored in one place. The tables
                  to the sides were created as a diagram to show how all my tables connect. The notices table is
                  combined with a member id associated with a member authorised to change the notice page.

        <p><b><i>Testing</i></b><br>
            In this sprint, I created a page that allowed me to test aspects of the database before adding it to the
            website. Testing will enable me to try parts of my website to ensure it works before adding them to the
            main website. As seen below, I tested to see if I could get information out of the tables and out onto a
            page. I pulled out two notices, and from the photos, you can see that the tables are working, and I was
            able to pull information out of them.
