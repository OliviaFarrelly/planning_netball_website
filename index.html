    <h2>Brief</h2>
        <p> I have been asked to develop a website for a netball squad called Hot Shots run by Dave Farrelly,
            this is a Wellington based squad<br>
            The objective is to create a website with information about the team and coaches, a place to find
            information about trains, a draw and results page blight, and a notices page that can also be updated.
            I also needed to make sure teh website was made fo rteh correct audience and was easy to undertsand and
            gave clear infromation across to anyone using the website(players, parents, coaches).

    <hr>


        Before starting the website I completed some User experince plannig. I looked at a few aspects to make sure my
        website was created for the correct reassn and teh right audience. Below are a few thingsi looked at when
        researching for my website.
        <ul>
        <li> I looked at the users that would be using this website and what they needed to see wehn looking online.
           </li>
        <li> I also did some comeptition analysis I looked at other netball websites and deicde what aspects
            of the website i liked and worked well for the website and what apsects didnt work as well </li>
        <li> I also did research on other webistes that were not netball webistes and found aspects that i liked that
        i could use as inspiration for my website</li>
            <li> I also created drawn plans of what i pictured my website to look like (which can always change as the
                website starts to be put together)</li>
        </ul>

                This means the database should work properly. This means the foreign keys that link tabel together
                need to be correct so the correct members are associated with the news post they made. Also to keep
                everything running smoothly the data needs to be consistent meaning the format of dates and times should
                be kept the same using the SQLite format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:00”. To make sure databases are functional,
                testing is important as well as creating entity relationship diagrams to see how everything should
                connect with each other.

                <div class="fw-bold">Future-proofing</div>
                 Future-proofing is about being able to keep your website up to date. Any corrections made should be
                made in one place and if needed in other tables they should be referenced using foreign keys. Foreign
                key means if the member is authorised to update the notices the member table will have to be linked to
                the notices table using a foreign key. This means that if there were any updates done to a name or a
                otice it would be changed without needing to change a lot of different code. Whether the information
                can be easily altered and old data can be removed, adding new information allows users to update the
                website on the website rather than having to go through code and having to change a range of things
                and altering what is already there.

                <div class="fw-bold">Privacy</div>
                Privacy is about making sure the data from the website and personal data is kept private. Passwords
                should be kept hidden when they are typing them. As Well as making sure that the data from the
                databases is kept private meaning that when users access the webpage they should be taken to the
                webpage not to the data folder. It is also important to respect users privacy so only collecting
                information that is needed for the website so you're not extracting unnecessary private information
                from users so there is less to keep private for them.

                <div class="fw-bold">End user considerations</div>
                This aspect was ensuring the database was arranged and organised to meet the needs of the users.
                It needs to be clear and easy to view as well as easy to understand. The database should be easy for
                the user to understand so forms that allow users to change aspects of the website should be easy to
                follow and should have validation to minimise errors and also help the user enter correct information
                to avoid problems.

            <h3 class="sprint">Sprint One</h3>
            <p><b><i>Brief</i></b><br>
            In this sprint, I wanted to start adding the aspect of databases to my webpage. I first started with my
                notices section. I wanted to create a delete, add, and update section for this section. This allows
                authorised users to update and change the notice section to make it more relevant and up-to-date. I
                said the date and time and who submitted or made the notice change so people who know who made it
                and when they made it could clearly understand what the notice is trying to say.
</p>
<div class="container-lg plan">

        <div class = "row">
                <div class = "col-sm-6 backing">

              <div class = "col-sm-6 backing">
              <h3 class="h3">Plan</h3>
              <hr>
                  <p class="subheading"> First, I created two tables: a notices table and a member table. The notice
                      table holds all the information about the notice so the title content, and the date. This is
                      connected to the member table, which has information on the coaching staff and the team members,
                      their emails and passwords, and whether they are authorised to make changes.

        </p>
              <p class="maintext">Tables are an excellent way to keep all information stored in one place. The tables
                  to the sides were created as a diagram to show how all my tables connect. The notices table is
                  combined with a member id associated with a member authorised to change the notice page.

    <br>
        <p><b><i>Testing</i></b><br>
            In this sprint, I created a page that allowed me to test aspects of the database before adding it to the
            website. Testing will enable me to try parts of my website to ensure it works before adding them to the
            main website. As seen below, I tested to see if I could get information out of the tables and out onto a
            page. I pulled out two notices, and from the photos, you can see that the tables are working, and I was
            able to pull information out of them.
        </p>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6 my-2">
           <img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src="assets/images/testingcode-sprint4.png" alt="Testing code">
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6 my-2">
            <img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src="assets/images/Testing-output-sprint4.png"  alt="Testing output"></div>
    </div>
    <p><b><i>Reflect</i></b><br></p>
             <ul >
                <li>Having the databases added, I was able to provide a way to update deleted and add new notices
                    without having to change the code in Pycharm. This meant it was easier for the users, in this case,
                    coaches, to update and ensure the website was updated so other users could get correct and
                    up-to-date information.<br></li>

                <li>With this aspect of it, a few things needed to be improved. I wanted to create a scroll box because
                    as more notices are added, it starts to push down everything on the whole page. Creating a scroll
                    box means users can see all the notices without affecting the page's overall look. However, due to
                    how the database worked, it took a lot of work to add the scroll box as the code was constantly
                    changing, so next time, I'd want to work on that.<br></li>

                <li>Also, in base plan for my notice page, I had an excellent gradient effect for the other notices.
                    Unfortunately, with databases, it is harder to create this effect as all the notices are changing,
                    and it could get too chaotic, so I had to choose one colour combination and stick with it. </li>
        </ul>
    <p>Overall the page looked good and was functional, and it did what it needed to to make things easier for
        the users. Having a update for teh notices allows the suer to update teh page without having to go
        through the code and risk changing teh wrong code and causing errors. This way of updating/adding/deleting gives
        the user a clear way to change teh webpage whcih is very important for a website.</p>

            <p><b><i>Brief</i></b><br>
                In this sprint I wanted to add a login page. I need to add this because I only want authorised users
                to update notices rather than anyone being able to update them. This allowed me to ensure that all the
                information on the page was correct and had not been changed by random people. This means that everyone
                was getting accurate information. It is important only authorised users like the coach can update the
                page as this website was made to infrom players and parents however if anyone can update and change the
                website the site is no use as the infromation won't be acurate.

                <li>If you click the login butto you go to a login page. You enter your credentials if they are invalid,
                    an error will appear. There is also validation on the login page, if you have not entered a proper
                    email address it will let you know what you have doen wrong so you are abel to see clearly what has
                    happend and make the change.Once logged in, it will say who's logged in at the top of the page. The
                    login button will turn into a logout button once you are logged in this is so people can clealy see
                    hwo to logout so they dont leave tehre account logged in and can keep the website accurate.<br> </li>

                <li>I allowed only authorised users to be able to update the website. Only authorised users could see
                    the new, edit and delete buttons when logged in. This meant that the information on the page was
                    only getting updated by users who would know the correct information. This made my website more
                    realistic amd reliable and indicated that the information shared was accurate.
<br>
</li>
                <li>The next step for teh webpage would be to create a new databse. This datbase will allow the
                authorised users to make changes to the draws and results. Wether that means updating, deleting or
                even adding a new draws or enetring in a new result. This part of the database is very importnat as it
                is a place where most common users of teh website go as they need to know the time for their games
                everyweek. </li>

    <p>Overall the login aspect of my databse is very important it helps to keep everything on the website relaible. As
        this is  a website for a sports squad it is very importnat you are porviding the, weith correct times, dates
        and reuslts as they need to be ready. The websiet is a way to inform members of the sqaud aswell as their
        caregivers what is going on each week. Communictaions in sports teams are very impirtnat so this website needs
        to be reliable and accurate to keep the trust in the Hot Shots Netball squad and keep people wnating to play
        for the squad. Thsi login system helps to keep everything running smoothly.

                In this sprint, I wanted to create a delete, add, and update section for my draws and results page.
                I also attached the login authorisation to this page. This allows authorised users to edit, add and

                who have no idea about the accurate information changing the draws and results so they are wrong.
                I wanted to connect the draws and results page so that when a draw is added, it will show with no scores
                on the results page, so it is easy to add the scores when it is time and makes less confusion and keeps
                evrything running more smoothly and just keeps the page more connected.

        <p><b><i>Testing</i></b><br>
            In this sprint, I used the testing page I created in sprint 4. Testing enabled me to try parts of my website
            to ensure they worked before adding them to the main website. As seen below, I tested to see if I
            could get information out of the tables and out onto a page. I pulled out the information on my game table.
            This ensured that I could retrieve the data from the table before I put all the rest of the code and
            connected it to my webpage. Doing these little tests helps me to make sure less errors occur. When an
            error happens in the webpage it is harder to sift through pages of code instead of a small amount of code.
            These test help to tets to see fi anything is wrong so we can make things less likely to crash.

    <p><b><i>Reflect</i></b><br></p>
             <ul >
                <li>I liked how I could incorporate my tables with databases for this aspect of my webpage. I liked
                    this as it gave a clean look to the page and didn't cause any problems. I had to add different
                    variables to ensure that all the dates were grouped on the draws page, which made the coding
                    difficult. Unlike the notices page, the styling wasn't thrown off, and everything was crisp
                    and clear.<br><br>

</li>

                <li>I also like how only authorised users can change anything on the draws & results page.
                    This meant that the information on the page was only getting changed by users who knew the correct
                    information. This ensured everyone using the website was being provided with accurate
                    information.<br><br></li>

                <li>I allowed only authorised users to update the draws and results. Only authorised users could see
                    the new, edit and delete buttons when logged in. This meant that the information on these draws
                    and results pages was accurate, so people knew the correct information. I liked how when a game
                    was added to the draws page, it was added to results with no scores, so the score can be updated
                    on the score page when a game is finished. It was an excellent way to have the page as the draws
                    and results pages connected, making everything run more smoothly.  <br><br></li>

                 <li>
                     The only thing that didn't work was that you could enter the same team playing each other,
                     which, if I were going to develop this further, I would learn how to work with. This is an issue as
                     in a netball game teh same exact team is unable to play with each other. This is inaccurate
                     infromation. As of rigth now i am unsure on how to work around this, so the solution for now is if
                     this occurs an authorised user either needs to login and update or delete the draw. This is not
                     the best solution but it is what will work for now until futher development.

                 </li>
        </ul>
    <p>Overall I liked how my page turned out. I like how authorised users were the only ones to update and change the
        pages. This meant that the information on the page was always accurate as no one was randomly playing with it.
        I also like how the colour scheme was kept the same throughout. Thai allowed the pages to be clear and to
        flow nicely. It also made everything feel more connected, which is nicer for users to look at. Too much
        information on each page makes users feel confident, which is essential if you want your website to be
        functional. I also ensured clear labels so users knew where to go if they needed to see the webpage.
        Overall, I liked how it turned out that I need to work on a few things that I need to work on developing
        more to do with my database which  have talked about in my reflections. As well as styling with databases,
        for example, my notices page was originally a gradient in colour. Unfortunately, with databases, I had to take them out, so fixing that would be the next step. Overall, the databases does what it needs to do, provides people with correct information that is up to date and is also reliable.

    <p class="subheading"><b>This is a video of how the Draws and Results page works. It shows how to update the
        draws and results pages and how everything is connected. In the video a new draw is added in, a game is deleted,
    a game is also updated. This is all connected to teh results page which is shown in the video. The results page
    is also updated which can be seen in teh video. Not only this but authorised users are the only users that can
    update the draws and results. This hleps to keep the page updated without having to go through the code. Going
    through the code increases the chance that soemthing will go worng and a n error will occur. Keeping everything able
    to be changed on teh website makes the website easier to use.</b></p>

                <div class="fw-bold">Functionality</div>
                Another critical aspect of a database is functionality. I tested different aspects of my website to
                ensure everything was running smoothly. When I first started creating my databases, I tested to see if
                I could pull information from the table about notices and what members wrote the notices. This was
                important as it allowed me to see if I could get this information out before adding it to the rest of
                my website. This ensured there weren't any problems with the extraction of data. If there was, I could
                tweak the code before adding it to my main page. I tested throughout the databases and a few tests are
                seen in the sprints above. Testing was essential to make sure my database was functional. I also ensured
                that no data was written twice for different tables. I ensured this by connecting tables with foreign
                keys. This helped ensure that information was not printed twice or inaccurate and doubled. I could
                extract information from different tables and print them out onto the page. This meant I didn't have
                to rewrite information repeatedly and made everything more concise and clear. This also meant if
                something was updated, it changed on every table that included the information, rather than having to
                change multiple aspects simultaneously. For example, if I changed a member's name, it would update the
                rest of the databases as the tables are all connected. This is all done with the foreign keys. I also
                ensured I kept the SQLite format “YYYY-MM-DD HH: MM:00” for dates. This allowed the data to be used all
                around the databases without causing any crashes. Keeping the same format so that everything would run
                smoothly, using the same format allowed me to use that information and just extract the parts I needed.
                This means I can use the date all over the database without any errors because all the data format is
                the same. Keeping the format ensures fewer errors and allows everything to pass through the same and
                run smoothly. The functionality of databases is very important, and keeping the format of aspects
                similar is very important to lower the risks of errors.

                <div class="fw-bold">Future-proofing</div>
                An important, relevant implication is future-proofing. How my database is created allows me to easily
                keep it up to date, whether it is adding new aspects of the database or updating or deleting aspects
                of the database. Using tables allows me to add new draws or notices as examples without sifting through
                the code. Having tables will allow me to add new database features (like connecting the register page
                and becoming a member) without updating any tables already there. This lowers the risk of causing
                errors as you're not messing with anything that is pre-existing. This makes it easier for users to
                update the website without having an understanding of the makeup of the website, as they don't have
                to change any preexisting code. As said above, the foreign keys help with updating the webpage. This
                means updates would only have to happen in the table, and any aspects of the database that are connected
                with the table you have changed will be updated. Also, updating exciting aspects of the website, like
                the draws and results, can happen on the web page; this can happen due to the databases. This makes it
                easier for users as there are clear forms only authorised users can fill out to add, delete and update
                the results and notices of the draw. This makes updating the website much clearer and doesn't lower the
                risk of an unexpressed user trying to go through the code and missing the code. Allowing authorised
                users only to update the website makes sure the information on the page is reliable and accurate,
                making the website one that people can rely on and trust as the days go by.

            </div>
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item d-flex justify-content-between align-items-start">
            <div class="ms-2 me-auto">
                <div class="fw-bold">Privacy</div>
                When creating a database for a netball squad, privacy was very important. Privacy is essential to
                protect individuals, as in the user's personal and squad's data. It is important to protect users'
                information as if it gets leaked, people will not be happy as that is a breach of their privacy but
                can also buy them at risk and make them less safe. The main way I have protected people's privacy is
                by not asking for too much personal information. Being a website like this, we are in charge of
                collecting and protecting users' information, dn it's our job to ensure their information is kept safe.
                I just collected their Name, ages and email to communicate with them if they join the squad. I have not
                asked for their phone number or address, which protects their location and phone number if anything
                happens and their information gets out. I also didn't want to collect information that is not needed
                in the databases for a few reasons: one, it takes up unnecessary space. But the main reason is that
                it's unnecessary personal information that we have to keep protected. Keeping the amount of personal
                information to a minimum helps to protect the user that's providing us with the information but makes
                things easier for us as there is less information to keep protected. One problem is that in the
                database, the password that people log in to their account with is not protected in the database if
                someone has access to the code, they can see people's passwords which is a great way of protecting
                people's privacy if I were to develop my database, further, this would be an area which would need
                some work and focus. I want the website to respect people's privacy so some aspects might need further
                development.

            <div class="ms-2 me-auto">
                <div class="fw-bold">End user considerations</div>
                The information I have put in a database is accessible through a website. It is essential that the data
                accessible on the website is laid out in a way the users would be familiar with. This meant the styles,
                colours, and fonts followed the trend of the rest of the website. It is crucial that this happens so
                the users do not get too overwhelmed with multiple different styles. It also helps them to feel
                confident that they are still on the same website as all the looks of the way the data is portrayed
                is the same as the rest of the website. I did this by ensuring the colours lined up, for example, when
                adding new data and updating pre-existing data forms, are used. These forms can be styled to follow the
                trend of the rest of the webpage. This told them they were updating or adding information to the right
                webpage not only when a change has been made to the page, whether it is a new notice or an update to
                the notices page; for example, when you submit the change it takes you back to the page where your
                data will be displayed so the user can get confirmation that here change has been made, an error page
                will also be displayed when something goes wrong to help the user know what they have done wrong and
                how to fix it.
