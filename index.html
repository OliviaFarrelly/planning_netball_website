    <h2>Brief</h2>
        <p> I have been asked to develop a website for a netball squad called Hot Shots run by Dave Farrelly,
            this is a Wellington based squad<br>
            The objective is to create a website with information about the team and coaches, a place to find
            information about trains, a draw and results page blight, and a notices page that can also be updated.
            I also needed to make sure teh website was made fo rteh correct audience and was easy to undertsand and
            gave clear infromation across to anyone using the website(players, parents, coaches).

    <hr>


        Before starting the website I completed some User experince plannig. I looked at a few aspects to make sure my
        website was created for the correct reassn and teh right audience. Below are a few thingsi looked at when
        researching for my website.
        <ul>
        <li> I looked at the users that would be using this website and what they needed to see wehn looking online.
           </li>
        <li> I also did some comeptition analysis I looked at other netball websites and deicde what aspects
            of the website i liked and worked well for the website and what apsects didnt work as well </li>
        <li> I also did research on other webistes that were not netball webistes and found aspects that i liked that
        i could use as inspiration for my website</li>
            <li> I also created drawn plans of what i pictured my website to look like (which can always change as the
                website starts to be put together)</li>
        </ul>

                This intellectual property is about aspects like copyright, design rights and others. This is all about
                the use of symbols and photos and information. Not using other people's information to create your
                website is about using your data. When creating a website, it is important that the ideas, images and
                text are not copied from another site without the permission of the person who owns the images or text,
                etc. You want your website to be authentic  so it is really important that you use your own ideas,
                images and text so you don't copyright.

                <div class="fw-bold">Accesibility</div>
                	Accessibility is about the function of the website. This means all the information is correct, and
                the website works the same on different browsers, as all devices are different. It is really important
                when creating a website that it is accessible to other users. Not everyone has the same type of device;
                some people look at phones or computers. Not only this, every device will be different which means the
                screen size may be different so it is important to make sure the website works across a range of
                different devices so everyone is able to access it and get the information they need.

                <div class="fw-bold">Functionality</div>
               Functionality is about ensuring the app, website, or database is useful. This means giving out
                information that is useful to people, adding only a little necessary information, and keeping it
                compact but informative.  Like accessibility, functionality is also about making sure it is functional
                on different browsers and devices too. Not only is this really important that there are no glitches
                or errors but if there are errors they are clearly labelled so the user knows what to do. Also, it is
                important the website loads quickly. As Well as all that any links need to work properly so the website
                runs smoothly and no user gets stuck trying to find the information they need.

                <div class="fw-bold">Aesthetics</div>
                Aesthetics are essential when it comes to a website. Users look at sites and are more into them if the
                website is pleasing. When it comes to the website, the CRAAP method can be helpful as it helps to
                incorporate all aspects of a website that will improve the overall look of the website. Aestichs
                is also about making sure the website is for the right audience. Based on who will be using it we
                don't want it to be too childish-looking if there are older viewers but not too confusing for younger
                kids trying to find their way around. We want to make it appealing for all users and clear and not too
                overwhelming so the website can do its job.

                <div class="fw-bold">Future proofing</div>
                Future-proofing is about being able to keep your website up to date. Making sure it can be easily
                changed by users who may need to be sure of the website's works. Whether the information can be easily
                altered and old data can be removed, adding new to update the website. It is important that the
                website can be expanded and improved without messing with any of the pre-existing aspects of the
                website. It is important the website can get altered easily so people who don't understand the website
                code are still able to change it when it is needed without messing up and risk making mistakes with the
                pre-existing code.

 <h3 class="sprint">Sprint One</h3>
            <p><b><i>Brief</i></b><br>
This first sprint aimed to create the website's front page. I started by gathering all the information about my page,
                this included photos and all the text that i wanted to put on my home page of my website. Once all my
                information was collected and all in one place I was able to place them all on the website as a rough
                layout.  I used Python to do this. After that, I wanted to style the rest of the page by adding
                galleries and other things to make the home page enticing.

                  This photo was taken halfway through working through databases. A project backlog is to help create a timeline
                  of what needs to be completed for each sprint. The tasks are put in priority order this helps ensure that the
                  websites aspects that are more important are prioritised so the website is created to its best ability.

    <p><b><i>Reflect</i></b><br></p>
             <ul >
                <li>This was the start of my website. I wanted to make sure the first page was visually pleasing. I
                    ensured I used similar colours around the whole page, making it manageable for the eyes. I liked how
                    it was clean and clear. There was no unnecessary information on the first page and everything was
                    laid out clearly.
<br></li>

                <li>I used this page as a tester to see how it worked, as I shrunk the website to ensure everything
                    would compact nicely. This helped me see how I needed everything to be laid out to make sure that
                    it would work with different-sized devices and browsers.
<br></li>

                <li>This was my first time working with Bootstrap, so I used the Bootstrap website to help me
                    understand how I could use that to my advantage and how to create different columns using Bootstrap.
                    That was the most challenging part, as I was new to it. I had to play around and test various
                    aspects of the website to ensure it was exactly how I wanted it.
 </li>
        </ul>
    <p>Overall the look of the website was very clear. The feel was very welcoming and too harsh on the eyes. I made
        sure my stakeholders found the homepage to be who they wanted it to be. I got them to test it and the coach
        decided there was some information that didn't need to be there and the sizing of some aspects was not right
        as well as finding errors that I was able to fix. The stakeholders found the website clear, easy to follow
        and was ready for me to move on. The next steps are to start making the other pages to be able to complete
        the website.

<h3 class="sprint">Sprint Two</h3>
            <p><b><i>Brief</i></b><br>
                In this sprint, I used Flask to create two more pages for my design, the team page, which included
                all the information about training, umpiring, fees and uniform, and the draws and results page, which
                consisted of draws and results from previous and upcoming weeks. Flask is a Python framework. Flask
                works by using a template. You want to keep the things in the template the same for every page. You then
                \can add the information for each page into it separately. These pages are run off a server, where all
                the styles, images and other templates are stored. Flask is helpful to help keep things consistent over
                all your pages with no extra work needed.

              <p><b><i>Project Backlog</i></b>


              <p> These are my project backlogs, showing everything I needed to get done for the teampage
                  as well as my draws and results pages of my website. This photo was taken halfway through working

    <p><b><i>Reflect</i></b><br></p>
             <ul >
                <li>I created a server for this sprint that helped me connect all my pages. I also made a layout page.
                    This page had all the code that I wanted to keep consistent throughout my page. This helped my
                    different pages flow nicely. In my layout, I had the footer, the navbar, and the background colour
                    to ensure everything stayed the same for the pages. This allowed me to focus on the new aspects
                    of the websites rather than having to copy and paste code repeatedly and risk causing errors.

<br></li>
                <li>
                    I liked how I kept my team page simple, using columns to separate different information using lots
                    of photos. I also liked using tables to make my draws and results page understandable. The simple
                    clear columns and tables help to keep everything crisp and less overwhelming. This helped make
                    these pages more clear to understand talking to my stakeholder. They liked the columns as they said
                    it made it easier to follow and they didn't get lost. They said they were able to go onto the page
                    and clearly locate the information they need with the columns and tables.

<br></li>
                   <li>I created a drop-down nav bar as I wanted to be able to have two different pages for draws and
                       results. This allowed users to go to one place on the navbar for draws and results however they
                       were able to select which one they wanted to see. Having these two separate pages made the
                       stakeholders less overwhelmed. They said it was nice to have separation between the two so you
                       could have all the information for draws or results on one page so everything wasn't mixed up.

<br></li>
                <li>Further down the track, I need to figure out how to update these pages as the draws change weekly.
                    This is a next step and further down the track I would like to add databases to my website so I'm
                    able to make changes on the page without having to change the code every week.

        </div>
 <p>Overall the look of the page and the way the layout was clear and not overwhelming which is how I wanted it to look.
     My users found it easy to follow and was able to understand the code. They found it aesthetically pleasing which is
     very important when it comes to a website. Not only this, they also found that the information on the page was
     concise and there was no unnecessary information. Having only the important information on the page meant that
     users don't have to sift through random information to find what they were looking for. Having clear labels in
     columns helped draw the user's eyes to wear to look. Have tables with dates for the draws page he,epd the users
     easily find what they were trying to find. Also having dates in order allowed users to find their dates clearly.
     Overall the website is looking and also functioning as it needs to. Next steps are to learn how to add databases
     to the pages so i'm able to update and edit the pages,

    <p><b><i>Some interetsing code</i></b><br></p>

    <p><b><i>Reflect</i></b><br></p>
             <ul >
                <li>For this sprint, I also used a flask to keep the layout the same. I created a form first. This form
                    asked for different information needed for a person entering the squad. This allowed users to put
                    in their registration to the team. It was a clear easy form to follow and the stakeholders told me
                    it was easy to understand which was very important.

<br></li>

                <li>I also made sure that the information on the form wasn't anything unnecessary or too personal,
                    this meant I was respecting users' privacy. Not asking for too much personal information was for
                    their state but also meant there was less information we had to keep protected that we didn't
                    actually need. This allowed users to rely on our website as we weren't not asking for information
                    that might seem creepy and like we are asking for too much from them. Checking with my stakeholders
                    they said that it was perfect that we were not asking for too much personal information as it made
                    the users feel more safe with what they were entering.

<br></li>

                <li>The register page has two buttons, a cancel button which takes you back to the home page, or a
                    submit button. The submit button took you to a new page I created called confirm. This page
                    is where you could either cancel your form, go back to the form page and edit it or submit your
                    form. I did this because some [people make mistakes when typing information, so having this page
                    allowed them to check their data before submitting it. Being able to check information makes sure
                    that the people registering will be properly registered and be able to participate in the squad
                    which is very important.

    <p>Overall the page was looking great teh website has now hot all the necessary information on it and wes looking
        good. Teh website now was able to give across all the information about the squad as well as notices and draws
        and results as well as the register page. The website wants to be overwhelming and has kept consensus so that
        all the information on the web page will be used. The webpage also had clear labels so the users who may not be
        as familiar with the pages were able to follow it around clearly. The use of flask and bootstrap allowed me to
        get work done faster in a more concise, clear way which is very important. The use of flasks also allowed us to
        make fewer errors which was very important and made the development process easier. The next steps for this
        would be to add databases to the page so users that were authroised can adapt aspects of the website from the
        website to risk less errors occurring. This is a very important next step as it will make the website more
        functional. The Look of the website is looking very good so the only change needed is databases as of right now.

                This means the database should work properly. This means the foreign keys that link tabel together
                need to be correct so the correct members are associated with the news post they made. Also to keep
                everything running smoothly the data needs to be consistent meaning the format of dates and times should
                be kept the same using the SQLite format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:00”. To make sure databases are functional,
                testing is important as well as creating entity relationship diagrams to see how everything should
                connect with each other.

                 Future-proofing is about being able to keep your website up to date. Any corrections made should be
                made in one place and if needed in other tables they should be referenced using foreign keys. Foreign
                key means if the member is authorised to update the notices the member table will have to be linked to
                the notices table using a foreign key. This means that if there were any updates done to a name or a
                otice it would be changed without needing to change a lot of different code. Whether the information
                can be easily altered and old data can be removed, adding new information allows users to update the
                website on the website rather than having to go through code and having to change a range of things
                and altering what is already there.

                Privacy is about making sure the data from the website and personal data is kept private. Passwords
                should be kept hidden when they are typing them. As Well as making sure that the data from the
                databases is kept private meaning that when users access the webpage they should be taken to the
                webpage not to the data folder. It is also important to respect users privacy so only collecting
                information that is needed for the website so you're not extracting unnecessary private information
                from users so there is less to keep private for them.

                It needs to be clear and easy to view as well as easy to understand. The database should be easy for
                the user to understand so forms that allow users to change aspects of the website should be easy to
                follow and should have validation to minimise errors and also help the user enter correct information

            <h3 class="sprint">Sprint One</h3>
            <p><b><i>Brief</i></b><br>
            In this sprint, I wanted to start adding the aspect of databases to my webpage. I first started with my
                notices section. I wanted to create a delete, add, and update section for this section. This allows
                authorised users to update and change the notice section to make it more relevant and up-to-date. I
                said the date and time and who submitted or made the notice change so people who know who made it
                and when they made it could clearly understand what the notice is trying to say.
</p>
<div class="container-lg plan">

        <div class = "row">

              <hr>
                  <p class="subheading"> First, I created two tables: a notices table and a member table. The notice
                      table holds all the information about the notice so the title content, and the date. This is
                      connected to the member table, which has information on the coaching staff and the team members,
                      their emails and passwords, and whether they are authorised to make changes.

        </p>
              <p class="maintext">Tables are an excellent way to keep all information stored in one place. The tables
                  to the sides were created as a diagram to show how all my tables connect. The notices table is
                  combined with a member id associated with a member authorised to change the notice page.

    <br>
        <p><b><i>Testing</i></b><br>
            In this sprint, I created a page that allowed me to test aspects of the database before adding it to the
            website. Testing will enable me to try parts of my website to ensure it works before adding them to the
            main website. As seen below, I tested to see if I could get information out of the tables and out onto a
            page. I pulled out two notices, and from the photos, you can see that the tables are working, and I was
            able to pull information out of them.
        </p>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6 my-2">

    </div>
    <p><b><i>Reflect</i></b><br></p>
             <ul >
                <li>Having the databases added, I was able to provide a way to update deleted and add new notices
                    without having to change the code in Pycharm. This meant it was easier for the users, in this case,
                    coaches, to update and ensure the website was updated so other users could get correct and
                    up-to-date information.<br></li>

                <li>With this aspect of it, a few things needed to be improved. I wanted to create a scroll box because
                    as more notices are added, it starts to push down everything on the whole page. Creating a scroll
                    box means users can see all the notices without affecting the page's overall look. However, due to
                    how the database worked, it took a lot of work to add the scroll box as the code was constantly
                    changing, so next time, I'd want to work on that.<br></li>

                <li>Also, in base plan for my notice page, I had an excellent gradient effect for the other notices.
                    Unfortunately, with databases, it is harder to create this effect as all the notices are changing,
                    and it could get too chaotic, so I had to choose one colour combination and stick with it. </li>
        </ul>
    <p>Overall the page looked good and was functional, and it did what it needed to to make things easier for
        the users. Having a update for teh notices allows the suer to update teh page without having to go
        through the code and risk changing teh wrong code and causing errors. This way of updating/adding/deleting gives
        the user a clear way to change teh webpage whcih is very important for a website.</p>

                In this sprint I wanted to add a login page. I need to add this because I only want authorised users
                to update notices rather than anyone being able to update them. This allowed me to ensure that all the
                information on the page was correct and had not been changed by random people. This means that everyone
                was getting accurate information. It is important only authorised users like the coach can update the
                page as this website was made to infrom players and parents however if anyone can update and change the
                website the site is no use as the infromation won't be acurate.

                I also attached the login authorisation to this page. This allows authorised users to edit, add and
                change the draws and results section to make it more relevant and up-to-date and avoid risking people
                who have no idea about the accurate information changing the draws and results so they are wrong.
                I wanted to connect the draws and results page so that when a draw is added, it will show with no scores
                on the results page, so it is easy to add the scores when it is time and makes less confusion and keeps
                evrything running more smoothly and just keeps the page more connected.

                      ERD or Entity relationship diagrams display the contents of a databases(so what is included
                  in each table). They help us to visualise how data is connected in a general way, and is useful for
                  constructing databases. They help us clearly see how everything connects and be able to create a
                  database that flows on nicely.

        <p><b><i>Testing</i></b><br>
            In this sprint, I used the testing page I created in sprint 4. Testing enabled me to try parts of my website
            to ensure they worked before adding them to the main website. As seen below, I tested to see if I
            could get information out of the tables and out onto a page. I pulled out the information on my game table.
            This ensured that I could retrieve the data from the table before I put all the rest of the code and
            connected it to my webpage. Doing these little tests helps me to make sure less errors occur. When an
            error happens in the webpage it is harder to sift through pages of code instead of a small amount of code.
            These test help to tets to see fi anything is wrong so we can make things less likely to crash.

    <p><b><i>Reflect</i></b><br></p>
             <ul >
                <li>I liked how I could incorporate my tables with databases for this aspect of my webpage. I liked
                    this as it gave a clean look to the page and didn't cause any problems. I had to add different
                    variables to ensure that all the dates were grouped on the draws page, which made the coding
                    difficult. Unlike the notices page, the styling wasn't thrown off, and everything was crisp
                    and clear.<br><br>

</li>

                <li>I also like how only authorised users can change anything on the draws & results page.
                    This meant that the information on the page was only getting changed by users who knew the correct
                    information. This ensured everyone using the website was being provided with accurate
                    information.<br><br></li>

                <li>I allowed only authorised users to update the draws and results. Only authorised users could see
                    the new, edit and delete buttons when logged in. This meant that the information on these draws
                    and results pages was accurate, so people knew the correct information. I liked how when a game
                    was added to the draws page, it was added to results with no scores, so the score can be updated
                    on the score page when a game is finished. It was an excellent way to have the page as the draws
                    and results pages connected, making everything run more smoothly.  <br><br></li>

                 <li>
                     The only thing that didn't work was that you could enter the same team playing each other,
                     which, if I were going to develop this further, I would learn how to work with. This is an issue as
                     in a netball game teh same exact team is unable to play with each other. This is inaccurate
                     infromation. As of rigth now i am unsure on how to work around this, so the solution for now is if
                     this occurs an authorised user either needs to login and update or delete the draw. This is not
                     the best solution but it is what will work for now until futher development.

                 </li>
        </ul>
    <p>Overall I liked how my page turned out. I like how authorised users were the only ones to update and change the
        pages. This meant that the information on the page was always accurate as no one was randomly playing with it.
        I also like how the colour scheme was kept the same throughout. Thai allowed the pages to be clear and to
        flow nicely. It also made everything feel more connected, which is nicer for users to look at. Too much
        information on each page makes users feel confident, which is essential if you want your website to be
        functional. I also ensured clear labels so users knew where to go if they needed to see the webpage.
        Overall, I liked how it turned out that I need to work on a few things that I need to work on developing
        more to do with my database which  have talked about in my reflections. As well as styling with databases,
        for example, my notices page was originally a gradient in colour. Unfortunately, with databases, I had to take them out, so fixing that would be the next step. Overall, the databases does what it needs to do, provides people with correct information that is up to date and is also reliable.

    <p class="subheading"><b>This is a video of how the Draws and Results page works. It shows how to update the
        draws and results pages and how everything is connected. In the video a new draw is added in, a game is deleted,
    a game is also updated. This is all connected to teh results page which is shown in the video. The results page
    is also updated which can be seen in teh video. Not only this but authorised users are the only users that can
    update the draws and results. This hleps to keep the page updated without having to go through the code. Going
    through the code increases the chance that soemthing will go worng and a n error will occur. Keeping everything able
    to be changed on teh website makes the website easier to use.</b></p>

                <div class="fw-bold">Functionality</div>
                Another critical aspect of a database is functionality. I tested different aspects of my website to
                ensure everything was running smoothly. When I first started creating my databases, I tested to see if
                I could pull information from the table about notices and what members wrote the notices. This was
                important as it allowed me to see if I could get this information out before adding it to the rest of
                my website. This ensured there weren't any problems with the extraction of data. If there was, I could
                tweak the code before adding it to my main page. I tested throughout the databases and a few tests are
                seen in the sprints above. Testing was essential to make sure my database was functional. I also ensured
                that no data was written twice for different tables. I ensured this by connecting tables with foreign
                keys. This helped ensure that information was not printed twice or inaccurate and doubled. I could
                extract information from different tables and print them out onto the page. This meant I didn't have
                to rewrite information repeatedly and made everything more concise and clear. This also meant if
                something was updated, it changed on every table that included the information, rather than having to
                change multiple aspects simultaneously. For example, if I changed a member's name, it would update the
                rest of the databases as the tables are all connected. This is all done with the foreign keys. I also
                ensured I kept the SQLite format “YYYY-MM-DD HH: MM:00” for dates. This allowed the data to be used all
                around the databases without causing any crashes. Keeping the same format so that everything would run
                smoothly, using the same format allowed me to use that information and just extract the parts I needed.
                This means I can use the date all over the database without any errors because all the data format is
                the same. Keeping the format ensures fewer errors and allows everything to pass through the same and
                run smoothly. The functionality of databases is very important, and keeping the format of aspects
                similar is very important to lower the risks of errors.

                <div class="fw-bold">Future-proofing</div>
                An important, relevant implication is future-proofing. How my database is created allows me to easily
                keep it up to date, whether it is adding new aspects of the database or updating or deleting aspects
                of the database. Using tables allows me to add new draws or notices as examples without sifting through
                the code. Having tables will allow me to add new database features (like connecting the register page
                and becoming a member) without updating any tables already there. This lowers the risk of causing
                errors as you're not messing with anything that is pre-existing. This makes it easier for users to
                update the website without having an understanding of the makeup of the website, as they don't have
                to change any preexisting code. As said above, the foreign keys help with updating the webpage. This
                means updates would only have to happen in the table, and any aspects of the database that are connected
                with the table you have changed will be updated. Also, updating exciting aspects of the website, like
                the draws and results, can happen on the web page; this can happen due to the databases. This makes it
                easier for users as there are clear forms only authorised users can fill out to add, delete and update
                the results and notices of the draw. This makes updating the website much clearer and doesn't lower the
                risk of an unexpressed user trying to go through the code and missing the code. Allowing authorised
                users only to update the website makes sure the information on the page is reliable and accurate,
                making the website one that people can rely on and trust as the days go by.

                <div class="fw-bold">Privacy</div>
                When creating a database for a netball squad, privacy was very important. Privacy is essential to
                protect individuals, as in the user's personal and squad's data. It is important to protect users'
                information as if it gets leaked, people will not be happy as that is a breach of their privacy but
                can also buy them at risk and make them less safe. The main way I have protected people's privacy is
                by not asking for too much personal information. Being a website like this, we are in charge of
                collecting and protecting users' information, dn it's our job to ensure their information is kept safe.
                I just collected their Name, ages and email to communicate with them if they join the squad. I have not
                asked for their phone number or address, which protects their location and phone number if anything
                happens and their information gets out. I also didn't want to collect information that is not needed
                in the databases for a few reasons: one, it takes up unnecessary space. But the main reason is that
                it's unnecessary personal information that we have to keep protected. Keeping the amount of personal
                information to a minimum helps to protect the user that's providing us with the information but makes
                things easier for us as there is less information to keep protected. One problem is that in the
                database, the password that people log in to their account with is not protected in the database if
                someone has access to the code, they can see people's passwords which is a great way of protecting
                people's privacy if I were to develop my database, further, this would be an area which would need
                some work and focus. I want the website to respect people's privacy so some aspects might need further
                development.

            <div class="ms-2 me-auto">
                <div class="fw-bold">End user considerations</div>
                The information I have put in a database is accessible through a website. It is essential that the data
                accessible on the website is laid out in a way the users would be familiar with. This meant the styles,
                colours, and fonts followed the trend of the rest of the website. It is crucial that this happens so
                the users do not get too overwhelmed with multiple different styles. It also helps them to feel
                confident that they are still on the same website as all the looks of the way the data is portrayed
                is the same as the rest of the website. I did this by ensuring the colours lined up, for example, when
                adding new data and updating pre-existing data forms, are used. These forms can be styled to follow the
                trend of the rest of the webpage. This told them they were updating or adding information to the right
                webpage not only when a change has been made to the page, whether it is a new notice or an update to
                the notices page; for example, when you submit the change it takes you back to the page where your
                data will be displayed so the user can get confirmation that here change has been made, an error page
                will also be displayed when something goes wrong to help the user know what they have done wrong and
                how to fix it.
